# FinalGame

## Quick Overview
- A PNG image drawn in MS Paint is converted into a playable platformer
- The image may contain rectangles of any size, and the color of the rectangles determines its role in the level (obstacle, player, portals, trampolines, growth potion, shrinking potion, door, key)
- The minimal (or close to) amount of in-game objects is created to represent each rectangle in the image (i.e., a 100x100 rectangle in the image is converted into one 100x100 object in the game, rather than 10000 1x1 objects)

This was the final project for a gr. 11 Java programming course
